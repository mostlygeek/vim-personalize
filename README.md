# About

These are my custom vim personalization, packaged as a plugin so I 
can easily manage and sync them with the different hosts I use. 

Since I already use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to manage
vim plugins. Vundle can fetch vim plugins directly from GitHub so I thought
why not manage my own tweaks there? 

## Updating my tweaks

Inside vim, `:BundleInstall!`

## Misc

* [vim Plugin Layout](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html#vimautoload) - this was immensely helpful

## .vimrc

This is mine, here as a reference. :)
